# ACE:Diablo2

## Purpose
ACE:Diablo2 is a third party tool built ontop of my [ACE engine](https://github.com/Stromner/ACE) that allows you to edit Diablo2 character files however you want, which does include cheating.

## Usage
**DO NOT USE ON A FILE THAT IS CURRENTLY IN GAME** - That is a surefire way to corrupt your save file

* Load your save file (java -jar <**jar file**>) and edit away! 
  * [Where do I find my save file?](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/370600-diablo-ii-lord-of-destruction/73541482)
* When done make sure to save it back to your system or the changes will be discarded when you exit the program.

## For devs
